	''' If you want to add a file, read here!

	First, you're going to need to put a function main(dp) at the ned
	of your file that runs dp.add_handler() on the functions you want
	to add to the bot.

	If your file is named foobar.py, you can do that like this:

	import foobar
	foobar.main(dp)

	import start
	start.main(dp)
